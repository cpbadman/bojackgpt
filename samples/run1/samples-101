"Babe, I am sorry about everything.
 I thought all that would go right.
" - Yes! Yes, sir, the time had finally come.

 - No, no, you had to go.

 - Yeah.

 Oh, my God, what a wonderful day.

  How is that possible?

  - Great.

 - Oh, look, we could try a number.

  - I don't know, I was afraid.

 - Well, I know, but I'll do it.

  No! Please do not do any of that.

  Well, my friend.
 I think the only reason I still have you here is because you had a good heart.

  - Well, you're welcome.

 - You're welcome.

  Oh, no.
 You're not welcome.

  I never know if I could've done this without you.

 I always know you're here, and I think you're really good at this business.

  I don't know, I just thought you two were the best of friends.

 You're a great person, and I wanted all of the reasons I wanted all of the reasons.

  [phone ringing.]

  I can't believe you're here.

  It's me and Princess Carolyn on a mission.
 I do, because you're really good at this business.

  I don't want you to think that you have this power, right?
  Because you have this power? You need me to put on a show and make a life for you.

  I need a girlfriend.

  What do I have? A girlfriend.

  Who are you? Are you the real Tina Turner?
  I don't know what to do, Todd! No! No! No! You stupid bitch.

  It doesn't feel good, does it? You need a girlfriend!
  - [gasps.]

 - Okay.

  I'm in it.
 And what do I do? I'm a rock star, and I want to make a living!
  I want to be a star! I mean, you would be a real superstar.

  - No!
 - What do you mean? I mean, not that.

  I mean, I feel like a rock star.

  It's hard.
 But I don't regret it.

  I regret everything that I did.

  I regret everything, the only thing that keeps me from being a star.

  If I could just write a song today,
  but sing a song now, I'd be the best!
  Because you deserve a world that is real and beautiful!
  I promise, I will never let you down!
  - Because I'm not gonna let you down!
 - Because I'm gonna make a life for you!
  [sighs.]

  I promise, I'm gonna make a change.

  I'm very good at this business.

  What the hell does that say about you?
  - I'm not your manager!
 - [phone ringing.]

  I need a girlfriend! I don't have any friends or any boyfriends
  No, I don't actually have friends or any boyfriends.

  You know what else you should add?
  You need to find something good.

  I mean, you could be more of a singer.

  Really? I don't know, I just thought.

  - I never thought what I was gonna say!
 - Sorry.

  - You're being selfish?
 - Do you want to tell me your feelings, but I don't know?
  What is happening to you? You're not helping me or making me feel different about myself.

  I mean, you're not the worst person.

  I am the friend of the town.

  You really do think that's a good name for yourself,
 and I don't think that you think I'm a good person.

  I do think you mean that stupidly.

  Well, we'll see how you respond.

  Just leave me, Todd, and let us go.

  No! I'm not leaving.

  [sighs.]

   I did what you told me to do.

 I did what you told me to do, which is,
  I just want to have fun.

 I know.

  I don't think you're really good at
 any of those things.

  But if you're good at both, then I think it's
 a good thing you're doing.

  And I do care about you.

  I'm your mom.

  You just wanna be a good person.

  You're not trying to be good.

  No, just don't be a good person.
