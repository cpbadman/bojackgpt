======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you you're not even really ready for this show or I'll embarrass you.

  Then you will have another idea about it so I can keep him away from you.

  Now it's off the record because you just can't come up with ideas?
  - Yeah
 - I don't wanna come up with any ideas.

  But I can tell at the end of the episode I'm ready.

  We're gonna keep on coming.

  You're not even gonna talk to me!
  Hey, this is why you're in this show is because you've been waiting for this whole episode, and as much as I love my job and the city
  I think this was just a waste of time, was
  you the only one who wanted the show off the record so I could finish it?
  - No
 - I said stop.

  - I thought we had a good run
 - But you didn't say anything about this show?
  You are the only one that wants our show to go anywhere, which is
  if you don't act like this, you'll never see tonight.

  I really don't want to see tonight.

  So, there you are.

  But you don't have
 all the answers and I'm not gonna get them all tonight.

  - I don't need it.

 - And I'm sorry.

  - Yeah.

 - You're just gonna have me all the way up.

  You mean, what if I'm a ghost?
  - Are you gonna let me be someone you're not?
 - Uh-huh.

  Oh, I am not a ghost
  - You mean as a ghost.

 - What?
  Are you a ghost?
 The ghost is the spirit of Christ.

   - Oh, God, I'm not a ghost.

 - I can hear you, and I can hear you.

  You can't go there!
  You're leaving your town!
  Are you leaving now?
  Yes, I'm leaving.

  Why is everyone being so rude?
  - I'm the ghost!
 - That's insane!
  The only reason you're here's because of me.

  No! You don't have to see this.

  - Oh!
 - You're right.

  This town, in the woods, is full of spirits.

  Oh, no!
  It's nothing!
 There are spirits there right now.

  Oh, I don't know what it's called.

  Oh, no, I don't know.
 Are you
  There are spirits in this town?
 Why do you keep asking
  - Do you love me?
 - It's not a question.
 It's just that it is hard.

  You must do what you do.

  You can't be everything, okay?
  No, I know that's the best way.

  - You're not the only one out here
 - I'll find this ghost who knows
  I know what it's called.

  A ghost?
  Don't get attached to me, okay?
  No, no, don't!
 - I'm not attached.

  I can't act like a ghost.

  I'm not a ghost.
 I'm not going to pretend.

  I know
 it's only a haunted place, but
  I'm not going to pretend to be there.

  We have to leave.

  All we can do is listen and
 we don't have to be there.

  All these ghosts are in the woods,
 as far as I'm concerned.

  But I can't
 - Stop.
 - Why?
  What?
  I want you to look at this ghost.

 You know what?
  All I can see is
  a ghost.
 It is what it says.

  It's an empty ghost.
 It's not some other ghost.

  All of this
 the ghosts are looking for
  - I have to say.

 - It's not a ghost.
 It's a haunting place.

  There's no more haunted place.

  There's never been
 anything like this.

  Is it true?
  Are the ghost stories true?
  No.
 In a way, they're not.

  You just don't get these ghosts, you can only
 see them.

  Maybe we can help them?
  I'm all alone, but I
 are always looking for ghosts.

   No, I am not a ghost!
  All these ghosts are in the woods,
 and
  That's not my ghost!
  Are you sure the ghost stories are true?
  No, they're
